{"issue":"LSF low vs target band","kpi_impact":{"LSF":"up","Blaine":"neutral","fCaO":"neutral"},"actions":[{"knob":"limestone_pct","delta_pct":0.5,"reason":"Increase CaO content to raise LSF towards the target range."},{"knob":"clay_pct","delta_pct":-0.5,"reason":"Offset limestone increase to maintain raw mix sum near 100%."}],"notes":"Monitor LSF closely after implementing these changes.  A further small adjustment might be needed depending on the response.  The small reduction in clay_pct is unlikely to significantly impact Blaine or fCaO, maintaining process stability."}
